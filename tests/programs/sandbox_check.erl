%% A one-file program for "beam.com build" that tests the sandbox
%% (--pledge and --unveil). It does the actions of its command line and
%% prints the result of each one:
%%
%%   sandbox_check read PATH    read a file
%%   sandbox_check write PATH   write a file
%%   sandbox_check listen       open a TCP socket on 127.0.0.1
%%
%% A result is "ok" or the error, for example "write: error eperm".
